Set Up Environment:\n","   - Install necessary libraries and frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Flask, OpenCV).\n","\n","2. Load Pretrained Inception V3 Model:\n","   - Download and load the pretrained Google Inception V3 model.\n","   - Ensure the model is ready for inference.\n","\n","3. Create Flask Application:\n","   - Set up a basic Flask application structure.\n","   - Configure routes for video upload, object search, and result display.\n","\n","4. Handle Video Upload:\n","   - Implement functionality to handle video file uploads.\n","   - Set a threshold for the maximum allowed memory size for uploads.\n","\n","5. Process Uploaded Video:\n","   - Extract frames from the uploaded video using a library like OpenCV.\n","   - Preprocess frames to match the input requirements of the Inception V3 model.\n","\n","6. Object Detection Using Inception V3:\n","   - Feed the preprocessed frames into the Inception V3 model.\n","   - Use the model's output to identify objects in each frame.\n","   - Store the frames and their corresponding detected objects.\n","\n","7. Implement Object Search Functionality:\n","   - Create a user interface for typing the search query.\n","   - Implement logic to search for the specified object in the stored frames.\n","\n","8. Display Search Results:\n","   - If the object is found, display the relevant frames to the user.\n","   - If the object is not found, display an error message \"Object doesn't exist!!!\".\n","\n","9. Test the Application:\n","   - Test the application with various videos and search queries to ensure it functions as expected.\n","   - Ensure edge cases (e.g., unsupported file types, large files) are handled gracefully.\n","\n","10. Deploy the Application:\n","    - Deploy the Flask application on a suitable platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).\n","    - Ensure the deployed application is accessible and performs well under expected load conditions.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"nh7g7BrvhjEu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import subprocess\n","\n","# List of packages to install\n","packages = [\n","    \"Flask\",\n","
