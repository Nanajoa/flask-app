# flask-app
The application focuses on harnessing the power of computer vision through a pretrained Google Inception V3 deep learning model, deployed via Flaskâ€”a Python web framework. This innovative tool allows users to upload videos within specified memory limits, initiating a sophisticated pipeline where the video is segmented into frames. Each frame undergoes analysis using Inception V3 to detect objects present within the video content. Users can interact with the application by entering search queries for specific objects they wish to identify within the uploaded video. Upon processing, the application returns and displays frames containing the queried object, providing users with visual confirmation. In cases where the object is not detected, the application responds with an error message indicating the absence of the specified object. This application exemplifies the convergence of advanced deep learning capabilities with user-friendly web technology, offering practical solutions in video content analysis and object detection for diverse applications ranging from security monitoring to content management systems.
